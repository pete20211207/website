Sponsorship and Donation
===============================================================================

Maybe you have used pgRouting for your research project or for some commercial application or something else. Then we hope that the library and the information on the pgRouting website helped you to get your work done. Or maybe you're planning to use pgRouting for your next project.

pgRouting is an Open Source project and so the users and the community are the most valuable and most important factor. pgRouting development is carried out largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. We appreciate every `feedback, question, bug report, patches and contributions <development>`_.

We would like to extend our activities and improve the quality of pgRouting. Your financial contribution will support the maintenance, improvement, and promotion of pgRouting. Sponsorship is not a way for individuals to control the development of the project, but rather a way of ensuring the longevity and overall health of the project.


How can you support the pgRouting Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two kinds of financial contributions, we accept:

* **Sponsorships**: a sponsorship is an annual commitment of funds to the project.
* **Donations**: a donation is a once off financial contribution to the project.

What is your benefit sponsoring the pgRouting Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsoring the pgRouting project provides the following benefits:

* Ensures the sustainability and health of the pgRouting project.
* All sponsors will be listed on the project sponsor page, ordered by contribution class (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) with a link back to the sponsor.

  * Platinum Sponsors will have their logo placed in the sidebar of pgrouting.org
  * Gold Sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page with a large logo (60k pixel, e.g. 300x200px)
  * Silver sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page with a medium size logo (30k pixel, e.g. 200x150px)
  * Bronze sponsors will be listed on the sponsors page without logo

* Sponsors will be allowed to use the pgRouting logo on their web site and show they are a sponsor of the pgRouting project
* Donors will be listed on the sponsors page upon request, but do not receive the additional benefits listed above for sponsors


How do we use financial support
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sponsorship funds will be spent to directly improve the code base of the project, to fund tasks that generally receive less attention from developers, and to fund work on peripheral project tasks so that core contributors can focus efforts on pgRouting improvements.

As an example, we would like to fund the following project activities:

* fund developers to work on specific aspects of pgRouting including implementing new features and fixing bugs
* improvement of documentation, workshop materials and tutorials
* scholarship for students, who applied for Google Summer of Code with a great pgRouting proposal, but were unable to receive one of the limited Google stipends
* implementation of a particular feature (if sponsorship is sufficient)
