How to sponsor
===============================================================================

Maybe you have used pgRouting for your research project or for some commercial
application or something else. Then we hope that the library and the information
on the pgRouting website helped you to get your work done. Or maybe you're
planning to use pgRouting for your next project.

pgRouting is an Open Source project and so the users and the community are the
most valuable and most important factor. pgRouting development is carried out
largely by a group of volunteers, that in time have built up a large, valuable
and useful code base, free to use and improve for everybody. We appreciate every
:ref:`development:feedback` about pgRouting.

We would like to extend our activities and improve the quality of pgRouting.
Your financial contribution will support the maintenance, improvement, and
promotion of pgRouting.

Sponsorship is not a way for individuals to control the development of the
project, but rather a way of ensuring the longevity and overall health of the
project.
