pgRouting extends the `PostGIS <https://postgis.net>`_ / `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org>`_ geospatial database to provide geospatial routing functionality.

Advantages of the database routing approach are:

* Data and attributes can be modified by many clients, like `QGIS <https://www.qgis.org>`_ through JDBC, ODBC, or directly using Pl/pgSQL. The clients can either be PCs or mobile devices.
* Data changes can be reflected instantaneously through the routing engine. There is no need for precalculation.
* The "cost" parameter can be dynamically calculated through SQL and its value can come from multiple fields or tables.

..
	.. note::

		It has been a long way but finally we made it: **pgRouting got on a new version!**
		For more details see:

		* New documentation: https://docs.pgrouting.org
		* New workshop: https://workshop.pgrouting.org

		Thanks to everyone who makes the new release possible!
		If you want to contribute to the project financially, any :doc:`sponsorship or donation <donate>` is of great help.
